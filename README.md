# Glasses-or-no-glasses-classifier
A simple CNN image classifier made with keras with the help of "Deep learning with python" book written by françois chollet.

There are some funny comments inside the code used to explain it to some friends 😁

I addaed a couple of images from the dataset as a template, I look old and bold for some reason but it's ok

I cann't share the complete dataset because it has images of some people I didn't ask for their permission to publish their faces online, so feel free to make your own dataset
